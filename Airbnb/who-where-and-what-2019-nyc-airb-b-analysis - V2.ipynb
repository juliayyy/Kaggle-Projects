The dataset includes 448895 records and 16 columns. \n\nWith the dataset, some general questions are explored and addressed:\n\n* Who are the owners of the listed homes? (Column: host_id, price, minimum_nights)\n* How are the homes located? (Columns: neighbourhood_group, neighborhood, price, room_type)\n* What are the other features of the homes? (Columns: number_of_reviews,availability_365)\n\nThis study tries to answer the questions by forming a bird's eye view of the overall Airbnb market of New York City in 2019 through some exploratory data analysis. Throughout the study, Python packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and WordCloud are mainly used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization. Based on the analysis, some business strategic thoughts are generated at the end of the study."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Content:\n\n1.

Learned from the some agency's website that those agencies operate similarly to Airbnb but with a smaller size, and used Airbnb as a listing channel. So for those agencies, Airbnb may consider adjusting the commission, on one hand, to increase the revenue, and on the other to balance the protection of the individual hosts. Secondly, the neighborhood information revealed that homes, especially the expensive ones, are more concentrated within the whole area of Manhattan,  north of Brooklyn, and west of Queens. So when considering branding and marketing activities, Airbnb can consider picking those locations where the Airbnb culture is well-represented. As Airbnb hosts are densely distributed in such regions, Airbnb should pay close attention to local regulations to avoid potential suspension risks. Last we checked some other features, such as the number of reviews, minimum nights required, and availability. We noticed that the most reviewed homes tend to be less expensive ones, which attracted more attention. So, Airbnb can consider further analyze the content of the reviews. For instance, Airbnb can find out positive influencers in the community by studying the review sensitivity and consider support or bonus."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
